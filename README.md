# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game
The Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game is a more complex version of the popular Rock, Paper, Scissors game that was shown on the TV show 'The Big Bang Theory'. This project aims to teach people about the games origin and how to play, as well as allow people to play the game virtually, and independently against the computer. Players can choose a weapon and fight against the computer, which will randomly choose a weapon. Scores and the remaining number of games are displayed and when no more games remain, a popup will display the overall outcome of the games. 

The target audience for the project would include people that have heard about the game before (perhaps fans of 'The Big Bang Theory') and want to learn how to play and practice against the computer, as well as people who have played before but have no one else to play against and consequently rely on playing against the computer.
